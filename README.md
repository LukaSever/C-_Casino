CASINO ( C++ project )

This project simulates a casino. 
There is a list of players who can choose between Blackjack or Pseudo Roulette. 
Each game has its own rules for how it is played. 
If a player loses, a certain amount will be deducted from their budget, and if they win, a certain amount will be added to their balance.
